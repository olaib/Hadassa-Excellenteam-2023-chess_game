# About the game

# About the project

## Part 1 - fixing bugs using debug

* in this part we will fix some bugs in the code using debugger
* There are some bugs in the code:
    - Something wrong with the knight
    - that playing chess against the bot built into the game is sometimes really easy, black seems to be much worse
      than white.
    - It seems that once the king is threatened, the game gets a little confusing.

## Part 2 - adding tests

* in this part we will add tests to the code
* we will use pytest to run the tests(integration tests, unit tests, system tests) to make sure the code is working
  properly
